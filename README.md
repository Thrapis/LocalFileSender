# What is this

This is an application for easy (for me) file sharing in `Local Area Network` for `Windows`. To use it you need:
1. Install [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)
2. Install [Application](https://github.com/Thrapis/LocalFileSender/releases/)
3. `Enable` the `visibility` of (`Server`) PC
4. In application (for the `Server` side) select `Shared Directory` and `Port` in Server Tab, then click `Start`
5. In application (for the `Client` side) enter `Hostname` (aka `IP`) and `Port` of the `Server PC` and select `Save Directory` in Client Tab, then click `Poll`. After getting of file list you should select files or folders you want, then click `Download`
